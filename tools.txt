instead of directly using ghidra or ida use strace or ltrace

strace docs
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strace-command-in-linux-with-examples/

to install strace

-> sudo apt install strace

now type 

->chmod +x <filename>  //for setting 

-> strace ./<filename>

this is how we can use strace 

but now i am going to show objdump


for disassembly

-> objdump -d ./<filename>

now let us use ghidra

search for favorite keyword 

now as this is a cross-referance(XREF) it shows part of code called or referenced

now try to understand the code

there are some basic if else statements

0x86187  //this is a hexadecimal number

we need to convert this in to decimal
 
after connverting we will get our desired number
